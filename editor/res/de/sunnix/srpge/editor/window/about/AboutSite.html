<p>This editor is intended for role-playing games with jump 'n' run, such as Alundra, <br>
    and offers a map editor in which the individual maps for the world can be created.<br>
    Resources such as music and graphics are loaded via a resource manager<br>
    and can then be adapted and selected for the game.<br>
    All of this data is saved in a game file which is then loaded and executed by the "Sunnix's RPG Engine"</p>
