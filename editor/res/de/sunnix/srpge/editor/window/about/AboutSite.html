<p>This editor is designed for creating role-playing games with platforming elements, similar to Alundra.<br>
    It includes a map editor for building the individual maps that make up the game world.<br>
    Resources like music and graphics are managed through a resource manager,<br>
    allowing them to be customized and selected for the game.<br>
    All data is saved in a game file, which is then loaded and executed by "Sunnix's RPG Engine".</p>
